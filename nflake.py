# Explanation of Turtle module: 
# Imagine that the turtle is a pen on paper. We can give the turtle step-by-step instructions 
# on how to move, where to go, and when/what to draw. By giving precise instructions to the 
# turtle based on algorithms, we can draw the n-flake.

def ngon(t, sides, length, factor, iterations):
    """
        This function uses recursion to draw the n-flake. It first goes to the deepest iteration level as
        defined by the user, then draws the smallest instance of the shape. Once this happens, it goes back
        out to the previous level, moves forward again, and draws another shape. It does this at each 
        level of iteration, for each side of the shape, until it is finished.
    """

        return            # iteration level (prevents infinite recursion).

                t.pendown()      # only of the smallest instace of the shape, instead of every level being drawn.
            t.left(360/sides)    # turn left degrees to make shape

rad = length / (2 * sin(radians(180/sides)))    # calculate length of radius of polygon (center to circumcircle)
apot = length / (2 * tan(radians(180/sides)))   # calculate length of apothem (center to midpoint of side)

'''
The following formula was found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-flake#In_two_dimensions.
The formula returns the scale factor that each side should be multiplied by between iterations.
This enables each smaller iteration of the fractal to be perfectly nested inside each previous
iteration, taking up the exact amount of space to be perfectly tangent with all other shapes.
